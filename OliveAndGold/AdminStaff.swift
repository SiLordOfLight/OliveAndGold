/*
 - Add new staff members here, you can remove the validate function, however it makes sure that the person you created is valid/working. (Spaced for clarity)
 
 - The staff VC automatically updates the view so all you need to do is add a new staff member by calling and filling in the parameters with CreateStaffMember!
 
 - When adding a new staff member, the order inwhich the function is called is *VITAL* to the order inwhich you see it on the screen. That being said, if you want to make it so it automatically updates the ordering - alphabetically as requested by Mr Barr - then feel free to do that!
